#JDD-Base

JDD-Base is a simple application built using modern Java technologies ([Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io/), [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), [Spock](https://code.google.com/p/spock/), [Java 8] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-whats-new-2157071.html))

## What is my task?
JDD-Base application is missing some implementation. Your task is to make all tests passing.

1. Open a terminal, `cd ~/repos/jdd-base` and run `./gradlew test` to see which tests are failing ([url](file:///Users/pawel/repos/jdd-base/build/reports/tests/index.html))
2. Fix the code to make all tests passing (start with MessageResourceTest)
3. Run the application via `./gradlew run` and check it out at http://localhost:8080/app. Remember to share your success on Twitter.

## Got stuck?
Check out the [Dropwizard documentation](http://dropwizard.io/getting-started.html#creating-a-resource-class) to learn how to code a RESTfull resource.
